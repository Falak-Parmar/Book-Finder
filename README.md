# 📚 Book Finder — Big Data Engineering Project

## Overview

This project is part of the **Big Data Engineering** course at **DA-IICT**. The objective is to design and implement a **robust data engineering pipeline** that transforms sparse university library records into a **high-quality, enriched dataset** suitable for powering an ML-based semantic book search system.

The motivating use case is:

> A user should be able to search for *"a story about a lonely robot in space"* and retrieve relevant books, even if those exact words do not appear in the original library metadata.

This repository implements **Phase 1 (Data Engineer role)** of the overall project.

---

## Problem Context & Motivation

University library datasets are typically **operational**, not analytical:

- Titles and authors are present
- Rich metadata (ISBNs, descriptions, subjects, thumbnails) is missing
- Records are inconsistent and difficult to use for downstream ML tasks

At DA-IICT, the library accession register CSV contains only:

- Accession metadata
- Title
- Author / Editor
- Publisher, Year, Pages

This project bridges that gap by:

1. Treating the DA-IICT CSV as the **ground-truth scope**
2. Enriching each record using **external public APIs** (Google Books)
3. Cleaning, deduplicating, and normalizing the data
4. Exposing the curated dataset via a **FastAPI service** for future ML use

---

## High-Level Architecture

The pipeline is designed as **four explicit stages**, mirroring real-world data engineering systems:

1. **Ingestion** – Collect raw data from multiple sources
2. **Transformation** – Clean, normalize, and deduplicate
3. **Storage** – Persist curated data in a relational database
4. **Serving** – Expose data through stable APIs

Each stage is implemented as a **separate module**, enabling clarity, testability, and extensibility.

---

## Data Sources

### Primary Source (Scope Anchor)

- **DA-IICT Library Accession Register (CSV)**
- Defines the authoritative list of books
- Ensures compliance with the DAU-only scope requirement

### Secondary Source (Enrichment)

- **Google Books API**
- Used only to enrich *existing DA-IICT titles*
- Provides:
  - ISBN-10 / ISBN-13
  - Descriptions / blurbs
  - Subjects / categories
  - Thumbnails and language metadata

No new books are introduced from APIs—only metadata augmentation is performed.

---

## Detailed Pipeline Design

### 1. Sync Layer (`sync_pipeline.py`)

**Purpose:** Handle synchronization with the library’s OPAC system and manage incremental updates.

**What it does:**

- Crawls the Koha OPAC “New Arrivals” shelf
- Dynamically identifies shelf IDs
- Downloads BibTeX records where possible

**Key Challenge:**

- The OPAC uses **Altcha**, a proof-of-work security mechanism that blocks automated scraping

**Design Decision:**

- Detect security blocks gracefully
- Fall back to existing records instead of corrupting the pipeline
- Log warnings rather than failing hard

This ensures the pipeline remains **fault-tolerant**.

---

### 2. Ingestion Layer (`ingestion.py`)

**Purpose:** Fetch rich metadata for DA-IICT books using external APIs.

**Key Design Choices:**

- **Asynchronous requests** using `aiohttp`
- **Concurrency control** via `asyncio.Semaphore`
- **Exponential backoff with jitter** to handle HTTP 429 rate limits
- **Incremental ingestion** using JSONL logs to avoid re-fetching data

**Why async?**

- The CSV contains \~36,000 records
- Synchronous API calls would be prohibitively slow and rate-limited

**Output:**

- Line-delimited JSON (`.jsonl`) files containing raw enriched metadata

---

### 3. Transformation Layer (`transformation.py`)

**Purpose:** Resolve real-world "dirty data" issues and prepare the dataset for storage.

**Operations performed:**

- Unicode normalization (handling non-standard characters)
- Title and author normalization
- Removal of placeholder / empty descriptions
- Deduplication using:
  - ISBN-13 (preferred)
  - Google Books ID (fallback)

**Conflict Resolution Strategy:**

- Prefer records with valid ISBNs
- Merge metadata instead of duplicating rows

This stage converts raw API responses into a **clean, analytical dataset**.

---

### 4. Storage Layer (`storage.py`, `db.py`)

**Purpose:** Persist curated data in a structured, queryable format.

**Technology:**

- SQLite
- SQLAlchemy ORM

**Why SQLite?**

- Lightweight and portable
- No external database dependency
- Ideal for coursework and reproducibility

**Schema Highlights:**

- `books` table
- Indexed columns on `isbn_13` and `title`
- Enforced schema integrity

---

### 5. Serving Layer (`serving.py`)

**Purpose:** Expose the curated dataset to downstream consumers (Phase 2: Data Scientist role).

**Implemented using:**

- FastAPI

**Endpoints:**

- `GET /books` – Paginated access to enriched books
- `GET /books/{isbn}` – ISBN-based lookup
- `GET /search` – Partial title/author search
- `GET /sync` – Trigger pipeline execution without stopping the API

**Design Principle:** Separation of concerns — the API does not perform ingestion logic directly; it orchestrates it.

---

## Orchestration (`main.py`)

`main.py` acts as the **control plane** of the system:

Execution order:

1. Run OPAC sync
2. Identify new or updated records
3. Trigger incremental ingestion
4. Apply transformations
5. Update SQLite database

This ensures:

- Idempotency
- Recoverability
- Minimal redundant computation

---

## LLM Usage & Transparency

LLMs were used as **assistive tools**, not black boxes.

All interactions are logged in:

```
logs/project_log.md
```

Each entry records:

- Purpose of the prompt
- Tool used
- Summary of response
- How the output was applied

This satisfies the project’s LLM policy and ensures full transparency.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, we gained hands-on experience with:

- Designing end-to-end data pipelines
- Asynchronous ingestion at scale
- API rate-limit handling
- Schema design and relational storage
- Serving data for ML workloads

Most importantly, the project demonstrates how **engineering decisions** directly affect the usability of downstream machine learning systems.

---

## Future Work (Phase 2)

- Generate embeddings from book descriptions
- Implement semantic search
- Rank results based on query relevance
- Build a lightweight frontend
